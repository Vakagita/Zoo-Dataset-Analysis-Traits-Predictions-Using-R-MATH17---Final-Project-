# Zoo-Dataset-Analysis-Traits-Predictions-Using-R-MATH17---Final-Project-
This project analyzes animal traits using the Zoo dataset to classify species through exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling. It includes visualizations, data summarization, and logistic regression to predict whether an animal is a mammal based on traits like hair, milk, and backbone. Demonstrating how data science can aid in species classification.
